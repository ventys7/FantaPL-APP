const API_KEY = process.env.APPWRITE_API_KEY; // I will need to ask user to run this with env var or hardcode temp key if I had one (I don't have the secret key here). 
// Wait, I cannot run this locally without the API Key. 
// I have to assume I can use the Function execution again or ask user to provide key?
// Actually, I can use the function but with better logging?
// Or I can ask the user to run it if they have the key? likely not.

// BETTER APPROACH: Create a temporary function payload that forces specific team IDs or logs extensively.
// The user said "mancano 5 squadre".
// I will inspect the API response for 2025 season using a rapid, small fetch tool if possible?
// I can use `curl` to fetch from the API directly if I have the football-data key?
// I saw the key in `main.js`? No, it's `process.env.RAPIDAPI_KEY`.
// I don't have the actual secrets. They are in Appwrite.

// So I MUST use the Appwrite Function.
// I will modify the function (v10) to specifically log the RAW list of teams it gets from the API.
// And specifically check for "Aston Villa", "Brighton", etc.
// And force the upsert even if validation fails (by relaxing validation).

console.log("This is a placeholder. I will modify the Appwrite function instead.");
